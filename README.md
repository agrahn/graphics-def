This first version of luatex.def is a modified version of pdftex.def.

This is only needed for LuaTeX releases from 0.87 on: it will not work with the version 0.80 in current TeX Live and MiKTeX distributions but is being made available for testing.

If you have a test version of LuaTeX 0.88 you may use this file via

`\usepackage[luatex]{graphicx}`
